# Web Development Assignment
This assignment focuses on creating a web application that fetches and displays product data from an API, with a user-friendly interface that includes search and filter capabilities, detailed product information, and pagination.

## Assignment Objectives

### API Integration:

Implement JavaScript code to fetch product data from the dummyjson.com/products API endpoint.
Ensure robust error handling for the API interactions to maintain application stability.
Data Display (Part 1):

Render product data on the homepage including essential details such as title, price, discount, category, stock availability, and thumbnail images.
Format the display to be clear and easily readable for the best user experience.
Data Display (Part 2):

Implement a detailed product information page that is accessible when a user clicks on a product. This page should include all product details and a gallery for product images.
Data Display (Part 3):

### Enhance the homepage with:

i. A search feature allowing users to find products by keywords, which may include part of the title, description, or category.
ii. A filter dropdown that lets users filter products by categories, updating the product list accordingly.
Application Pagination (Bonus):

If the API response contains more than 10 products, display only 10 products at a time and add pagination controls at the bottom of the list to navigate through the pages.
